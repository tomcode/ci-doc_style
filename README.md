============

**Under construction**  

Right now it's just a collection of my various different versions I use. Working on a unified version.

**The tag contentId**

Contains the last version with an ID #content. In later versions the ID is replaced with the class .content.


Contains:

- the separated assets of a CodeIgniter vanilla distribution
- another TOC drop down script which fetches it's contents from the main application

Intended use as submodule within a master repository such as as [tomcode/ci-project][1].
