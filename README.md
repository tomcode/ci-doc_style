============

**Under construction**  
Right now it's just a collection of my various different versions I use. Working on a unified version.

Contains:

- the separated assets of a CodeIgniter vanilla distribution
- another TOC drop down script which fetches it's contents from the main application

Intented use as submodule within a master repository such as as [tomcode/ci-project][1].
